FPGA-accelerated CNN inference on Zynq platforms, comparing CPU-only execution with an HLS-based hardware accelerator for edge AI workloads.
This repository presents a step-by-step implementation of a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deployed on a Xilinx Zynq-based platform. The project focuses on comparing software-only CNN inference on an ARM CPU with an FPGA-accelerated implementation using Vitis HLS, highlighting performance gains in latency and throughput for embedded edge-AI applications.
